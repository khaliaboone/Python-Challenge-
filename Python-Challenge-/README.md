# Python-Challenge-

While building my codes for each PyBank and Pypoll I was able to assess which vairiables and strings to use. I started off with importing my data via the csv so that I read the files in my code. I was able to get my code established with help from "ChatGPT". I learned what each line in the code represented and why it was carried out in the manner in which it typed. I was able to determine the greatest increase and decrease for the budget data provided. My code had errors intially and I was able to get those cleared up with the help of "ChatGPT" and my tutor. 
For the PyPoll code I was unsucessful in creating a code that could be read. I acquired help from ChatGPT and my own knowledge and that didn't suffice. I'm not sure how but it was unable to read my file path for the election results. From the beginning of the code the results I received were blank with no data printed once the code was ran. I changed the direction for the file path and then it somehow produced error messages each time. Although one of my codes were unsucessful, I still feel confident in what I was able to produce.
